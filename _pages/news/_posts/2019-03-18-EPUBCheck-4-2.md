EPUBCheck v4.2.0-rc, a release candidate of the forthcoming v4.2.0 version, is now available at the following page:

[https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases/tag/v4.2.0-rc](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases/tag/v4.2.0-rc)

With this Release Candidate, EPUBCheck now features full support for EPUB 3.2.

The changes since the last beta release include support for remote fonts, remote resources in scripts, checking the reading order in the Navigation Document, extended support to HTML’s 'picture' element and 'srcset' attribute, as well as various other bug fixes and small improvements (details in the release notes, on the release page).

This release is the last step before the final release. It’s now the right time to test it in your own production workflows!

Please keep in mind, however, that although this release candidate version is not _yet_ intended for production, we don’t expect to add any new features before release v4.2.0. In other words, if this release works for you in production, v4.2.0 should as well (that is, unless we get some precious bug reports!).

More details can be found on the W3C blog [here](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/03/epubcheck-4-2-0-rc-published/).

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed!
