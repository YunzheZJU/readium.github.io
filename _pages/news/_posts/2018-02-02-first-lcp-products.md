EDRLab is proud to announce that the first LCP-enabled servers and the first LCP app have been released!

ePagine, the French distribution platform of independent booksellers, and an EDRLab member, had been one of the first companies to demonstrate an EPUB compliant service in beta during the EPUB Summit 2017 in Brussels.

This week, ePagine, has launched the production version of this platform, after being certified Readium LCP compliant by EDRLab. On http://lcp.epagine.fr,  one can get free EPUB ebooks, or buy one, and enjoy reading the publication on the first LCP compliant reading application on the market, Lis-a by Art Book Magazine.

Note that the LCP license server ePagine put in place is based on the readium-lcp-server open-source codebase that EDRLab has developed for easing the integration of Readium LCP in distribution platforms. Thanks to Stefaan Nemegeer, from ePagine, for his help in fixing some issues on the server code: this is how open-source projets should go.

Lis-a, the universal reading application for iOS developed by Art Book Magazine, is the first Readium LCP compliant application on the App Store.

Lis-a is an iPad/iPhone application. It is built upon the Readium SDK (Readium “1”), reads EPUB 2, EPUB 3 fixed layout and reflowable publications, and even PDF files. 

Art Book Magazine is a French company and digital bookstore focusing on “arty” publications, and a new member of EDRLab.

With the launch of this application, at the same time DeMarque and ePagine launch their server-side distribution solutions, plus several other LCP compliant reading applications and licence servers under active development, we can state that the Readium LCP ecosystem is now taking shape. 
We are happy to announce that Cantook Hub, the distribution platform for digital books from DeMarque, is now compliant with Readium LCP. 

This opens the way to the distribution of Readium LCP protected EPUB files in every distribution platform operated by Cantook servers.

This is the case for Eden Livres in France, especially in the context of the PNB (Prêt Numérique en Bibliothèque) platform. PNB is the main e-lending platform in France, with thousands of public libraries already connected.

This is also the case for Lirtuel in Belgium. Lirtuel is the e-lending library portal of the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles, which groups 350 francophone public libraries.

And this is the case for many other platform operated by DeMarque in Canada and other countries.
