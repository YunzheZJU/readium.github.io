The Readium development community regrets to announce the end-of-life (EOL) for the Readium Chrome app.  Release 0.31 will therefore be the final release of the Readium Chrome application.  Google warned in early 2017 that the Chrome framework (on which the app is based) would be deprecated and then disabled sometime in 2018.  In addition, Googleâ€™s changes to their security rules (e.g. no inline scripts) has already partially crippled the application.  Therefore we have made the decision to cease supporting and releasing the app. 

The final change to the app is that it puts up a modal dialog every time the library view is refreshed.  The dialog states that the app is being deprecated and will be taken down before the end of 2018.
The Readium CloudReader will continue to be supported and bad bugs (i.e. crash and/or data loss) fixed, but no new features are planned.

The Readium SDK and the CloudReader (i.e. the ReadiumJS stack) are now officially in maintenance mode.  We will of course fix bad bugs (i.e. crash and/or data loss) but there is no plan at this time to develop new features.
