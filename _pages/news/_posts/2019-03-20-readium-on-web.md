NYU Libraries hosted a meeting on March 18-19 on the present and future of Readium on the Web. This small meeting (<20 participants) heard about past and present efforts to build applications with Readium on the web, and how we can collaboratively develop ideas for the development and promotion of Readium Web and related projects. 

NYU Libraries and NYU Press, which has used Readium in its Open Access Books platform since 2014, has engaged Evident Point to help develop Readium Web along with a basic user-facing reader. We hope that this work will stimulate further contributions to web-based Readium projects.
