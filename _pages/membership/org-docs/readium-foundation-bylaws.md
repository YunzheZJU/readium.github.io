**ARTICLE I**

**NAME, PURPOSE AND OFFICES**

_Section 1.1      Name_

The name of the corporation is “Readium Foundation” and the corporation is referred to in these By-laws as the “Foundation”.

_Section 1.2      Principal Office_

The principal office of the Foundation shall be located at 93 S. Jackson St.  Ste 70719 Seattle, WA 98104, United States of America. The Board of Directors of the Foundation (the “Board of Directors”) is hereby granted full power and authority to change its principal office from one location to another both within and without said state.

_Section 1.3      Other Offices_

Branch or subordinate offices may at any time be established by the Board of Directors at any place or places.

_Section 1.4      Purpose_

The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by the Foundation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations which are organized not for profit may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  The primary purpose of the Foundation is to engage in some or all of the following activities: (a) advance the creation, evolution, promotion, and support of software tools supporting the EPUB open standard environment (“Software”), (b) promote the development and adoption of open, accessible standards and specifications relating thereto (“Specifications”); (c) promote such Specifications and Software worldwide; and (d) undertake such other activities as may from time to time be appropriate to further the purposes and achieve the goals set forth above.

_Section 1.5      Nonprofit Status_

In the event that such exemption is sought and until such time, if ever, as such exemption is denied or lost, the Foundation shall not knowingly  engage directly or indirectly in any activity that it believes would be likely to invalidate its status as an organization exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code as an organization described in Section 501(c) of the Code.  All references to the Code contained herein are deemed to include corresponding provisions of any future United States Internal Revenue Law.

(b)  If a Member is itself a Foundation, membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member shall extend only to the paid representatives (employees and individuals serving on a contractor basis) of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors in a specific case from time to time.

_Section 2.7      Termination or Suspension of Membership_

Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by the Board of Directors for failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the Foundation, that is contrary to the interests of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals.  Financial Obligations already paid shall not be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due and payable.  Terminations or suspensions of Membership for failure to satisfy Financial Obligations may be imposed with notice and without right of formal appeal under such procedures as the Board of Directors may from time to time approve.  Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.7, no termination or suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:

(a)  The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership and of the reasons therefor;

(b)  Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the Foundation’s records;

(c)  Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership; and

(d)  Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board of Directors (or other body authorized by the Board of Directors) to decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board of Directors believes in good faith that a Member is engaging in willful misconduct to the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, the Board of Directors may suspend such Member’s Membership immediately, provided that such Member is otherwise afforded the protections provided for in subsections (a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.7.

_Section 2.8      Resignation by Member_

A Member may resign as a Member at any time upon notice to the Foundation in writing or by electronic transmission at the principal place of business of the Foundation or to the President or Secretary.  Any Financial Obligations already paid by such Member shall not be refundable in such event, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall remain due and payable. 

_Section 2.9      Membership Book_

The name and address of each Member shall be contained in a membership book to be maintained at the principal office of the Foundation (the “Membership Book”).  Termination of any Membership shall be recorded in the Membership Book together with the date of such termination.  Each Member shall be responsible for apprising the Foundation in writing of all changes to its name and address, and of the names and addresses of all representatives of such Member appointed to be members of Member Committees designated by such Member in its application for Membership or to receive notices or to vote on behalf of such Member.

_Section 2.10    Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees_

(a)        The Foundation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors, but a Member upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable, except where the Member is, by contract with the Foundation or otherwise, independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees.  No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself, create such liability.  In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.

(b)  The Board of Directors may exchange Memberships of the Foundation with other consortia, trade associations and similar non-profit organizations on a no-fee or reduced-fee basis, where the Board of Directors determines that such cross membership is in the best interests of the Foundation and its Members.

_Section 2.11    Use of Names_

Neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the name of the other in any form of publicity without the written permission of the other, provided that the Foundation and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Foundation has not made a filing under the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, as amended, a Member may request that its Membership not be disclosed if it makes a written request to such effect at the time of application to the Foundation for Membership.

**ARTICLE III**

**MEETINGS OF MEMBERS**

All meetings of the Members shall physically be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware, or as may otherwise be permitted by law, and at such time as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President of the Foundation (the “President”), or if not so designated, at the registered office of the Foundation.

_Section 3.2      Annual Meeting_

Annual meetings of Members ordinarily shall be held by written consent pursuant to Section 3.10.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Board of Directors may call any annual meeting to be held in person and each such meeting, once called, shall take place on the second Tuesday in September of the applicable year, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the second secular day following, at 10:00 a.m. local time, or at such other date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or the Chairperson, if any.  Pursuant to such written consent, or at such meeting, as applicable, the Voting Members shall elect a Board of Directors in accordance with Section 4.3 and shall transact such other business as may properly be addressed by written consent, or at such meeting, as applicable.  If no annual meeting is held (and no annual consent has been executed) in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Board of Directors shall cause a meeting to be held as soon thereafter as convenient, which meeting shall be designated a special meeting in lieu of annual meeting.

_Section 3.3      Special Meetings_

Special meetings of the Members, for any purpose or purposes, may, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, be called by the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Directors then in office, or at the request in writing of Voting Members entitled to vote at least ten percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members.  Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.  Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

Upon request by any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of the Voting Members, the President, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors (the “Chairperson”) (if any), any Vice-President or the Secretary shall, within thirty days after receipt of the request, cause notice to be given to the Voting Members entitled to vote at such meeting that a special meeting will be held at a time chosen by the Board of Directors, but not less than thirty-five nor more than ninety days after receipt of such request.

_Section 3.4      Notice of Meetings_

Except as otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, written notice of each meeting of the Members, annual or special, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and such other information as may be required by law shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each Member entitled to attend such meeting.

_Section 3.5      Voting List_

The Officer who has charge of the Membership Book of the Foundation shall prepare and make a complete list of the Members entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each such Member.  Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Foundation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any Member, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Foundation.  In the event that the Foundation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Foundation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Members of the Foundation.  The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Member who is present. 

_Section 3.6      Quorum_

Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, Voting Members entitled to vote more than twenty percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members (or such higher percentage of Voting Members as may be required by law, these By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation to approve any action to be taken at such meeting), present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the Members for the transaction of business.  Member Committees shall have the same rules relating to quorum requirements and voting majorities as provided for in these By-laws, unless otherwise approved by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors.

_Section 3.7      Adjournments_

Any meeting of Members may be adjourned from time to time without notice to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of Members may be held under these By-laws or by law if the time and place of such adjourned meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which Members may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting and such other information as may be required by law are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  Such adjournment shall be approved by a majority of the Voting Members present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at such meeting (regardless of whether a quorum is present), or, if no Voting Member is present or represented by proxy, by any Officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting.  At any reconvened meeting following such an adjournment the Foundation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to all Members entitled to attend such meeting.

_Section 3.8      Action at Meetings_

(a)  Unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a different vote is required (in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question), when a quorum is present at any meeting of Members, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the question, shall decide any question brought before such meeting.

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 3.8(a), in the event that any vote is to be taken of a single class of Voting Members, then a quorum for such vote shall be not less than fifty percent of the Voting Members of that class, and when such quorum is present, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of the Voting Members of that class present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the question, shall decide such question.

Section 3.9      Proxies
Each Member entitled to vote with respect to any corporate action at a meeting of Members, or to express consent or dissent to any corporate action in writing without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  Without limiting the manner in which a Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy pursuant to this Section, the following shall constitute valid means by which a Member may grant such authority:

(a)  A Member may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the Member or such Member’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

(b)  A Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the Member.  If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.

_Section 3.10    Action Without Meeting_

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of Members, or at any meeting of a Member Committee, Sub- Group thereof or other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by Members (or members of a class of Members, as the case may be) making up not less than that percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  Prompt notice of the taking of any corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those otherwise entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in writing.  An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a Member or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can determine (A) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the Member or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such Member or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission.  The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.  No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Foundation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or an Officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of Members are recorded.  Delivery made to the Foundation’s registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of Members are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Foundation.

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

_Section 3.11    Nomination and Election Procedures_

Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board of Directors shall establish reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the Foundation, including a reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee’s qualifications and the reasons for the nominee’s candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a reasonable opportunity for all Members entitled to vote thereon to choose among the nominees.

_Section 3.12    Order of Business_

The order of business at all meetings of Members shall be as determined by the presiding Officer, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the Voting Members. 

**ARTICLE IV**

**DIRECTORS**

_Section 4.1      Powers; Voting_

The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be managed by its Board of Directors, which shall be, and shall possess all of the powers of, the “Governing Body” of the Foundation as a not-for-profit membership corporation under Delaware General Corporation Law.  The Board of Directors may exercise all powers of the Foundation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the Members. 

_Section 4.2      Number and Classes of Directors_

Subject to Section 4.4, the total number of Directors shall be be nine (9).

Each director shall be assigned to Class A, Class B, or Class C, and an effort shall be made to keep each class of directors of approximately equal size. Each director shall hold office for a term of three years, and thereafter until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal, except that for the initial Board elected in 2014:
a. Directors in Class A shall have their term expire in 2015 (and every three years thereafter); 
b. Directors in Class B shall have their term expire in 2016 (and every three years thereafter); and 
c. Directors in Class C shall have their term expire in 2017 (and every three years thereafter). 
 
No Director shall continuously serve more than two (2) consecutive three-year terms. Fulfilling an incomplete term is not considered part of the term limit.
Section 4.3      Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors

(a)  Each General Member (while remaining in good standing) shall be entitled to nominate one individual for election as a Director, and to participate in the election of Directors.  Directors shall be elected by vote of the General Members at the annual meeting or at any special meeting of Members, each director so elected shall have a term of one year, and thereafter until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.

(b)  Each Director shall hold office until the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the term for which such Director was elected and such Director’s successor is elected and qualified, (ii) the expiration or termination of Membership of the Member that designated such Director (if so designated), (iii) the death, resignation or removal of such Director, (iv) if applicable, the combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of two Members that each have representatives on the Board of Directors, upon which event one of the two representatives, as designated by the surviving Member, shall be deemed to have resigned or (v) if applicable, if requested by the Board of Directors, upon the termination of the employment of such Director by the Member represented by such Director.  In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has a representative serving as a Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.7 above, the attendance and voting rights of such Director representative shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as such suspension is lifted.

(e)  Each Director (or, if applicable, the Member that designated or is the employer of such Director) may designate in writing (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such Director or Member) an individual to act as a Director in his or her stead, whether for a single meeting or as a standing alternate.  Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) attend and vote at all meetings which the designating Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of the designating Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating Director.  In addition, in lieu of making such a substitution, any Director who will be absent for any meeting may deliver a written proxy to the President, authorizing the President to either vote as instructed in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of such absent Director in such manner as the President may believe appropriate.  Any such proxy shall be valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with respect to all matters, if so desired) as may be stated in such proxy.

(f)  The Board of Directors may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the Board of Directors are held by active, contributing individuals.  Such rules may provide that any Member which has elected or nominated a Director, as the case may be, may lose its ability to elect and/or nominate a representative to the Board of Directors in the event that such requirements have not been met, and/or that a Director who fails to meet such requirements shall automatically be deemed to have resigned from the Board of Directors, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.

_Section 4.4      Enlargement or Reduction_

Subject to Section 2.6 above, the number of Directors, the persons eligible to become Directors and the classes of Members eligible to elect and/or nominate Directors may be amended at any time by a vote of the Board of Directors or by a vote of the Voting Members.

_Section 4.5      Resignation and Removal_

Any Director may resign at any time upon notice to the Foundation in writing or by electronic transmission at the principal place of business of the Foundation or to the President or Secretary.  Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event.  If applicable, any Director who was designated by a Member under Section 4.3 may be removed by that Member.  Any or all of the Directors who were elected by a class of Members voting as a class or by the Board of Directors may be removed by a majority vote of such class of Members or Board of Directors, respectively.  Unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any Director may be removed by a majority of the other Directors then in office for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the Foundation, that is contrary to the interests of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals; provided, however, that the Member or class of Members that designated and elected or nominated and elected (as the case may be) such removed Director shall be entitled to designate and elect or nominate and elect (as the case may be) a replacement for such removed Director to serve for the balance of such removed Director’s term.

_Section 4.6      Vacancies_

(a)  Vacancies on the Board of Directors occurring as a result of the death, resignation or removal of a Director who was designated and elected by a Member, if applicable, may be filled by such Member.  All other vacancies shall be filled by the vote of a majority of Directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director, if any, or by vote of the Members entitled to elect Directors under Section 4.3.  The term of a Director so designated or elected shall be the unexpired portion of the term of the Director, if any, whom the Director so appointed or elected is replacing.

(b)  In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.

_Section 4.7      Place of Meetings_

The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

_Section 4.8      Regular Meetings_

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors; provided that any Director who is absent when such a determination is made shall be given prompt notice of such determination.  A regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of Members.

(a)        Whenever, under the provisions of law, or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, written notice is required to be given to any Director or Member, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such Director or Member, at his, her or its address as it appears on the records of the Foundation, with postage thereon prepaid.  Unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another provision of these By-laws, and subject to the provisions below relating to notice by electronic transmission to Members, written notice may also be given by electronic mail, telecopy, commercial delivery service, or similar means, addressed to such Director or Member at his, her or its address as it appears on the records of the Foundation.  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, any notice to Members given by the Foundation under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-laws, unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another provision of these By-laws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the Member to whom the notice is given.  Any consent by a Member to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by that Member by written notice to the Foundation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the Foundation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Foundation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Foundation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.   

(b)  Notice given pursuant to this Section shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication (A) to a Member, when directed to a number at which the Member has consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to the number for such Director as it appears on the records of the Foundation; (2) if by electronic mail to (A) a Member, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the Member has consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to the electronic mail address for such Director as it appears on the records of the Foundation; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the Member or Director of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the Member or Director; (5) if by in-hand delivery or oral notice, at the time it is actually given; (6) if by mail, three days after the same shall be deposited in the United States mail; and (7) if by commercial delivery carrier or similar means, at the time when the same shall be deposited with the carrier, in each case the transmission charge to be paid by the Foundation or the person sending such notice and not by the addressee.  An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Foundation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

(c) For purposes of these By-laws, “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

(d)  Without limiting the foregoing, the Foundation adopts electronic mail as its principal source of communication with its Members.  Each Member acknowledges and agrees that the Foundation shall not be under any obligation (except as required by law or these By-laws) to send any notice to any Member by any means other than electronic mail, and it is therefore the responsibility of each Member to avail itself of and make such arrangements as may be necessary to receive notice in such fashion. 

_Section 7.2      Waiver of Notice_

Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these By-laws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

_Section 8.2      Actions by or in the Right of the Foundation_

_Section 8.4      Specific Authorization_

Any indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Foundation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of any person described in said Sections is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections.

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Foundation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification by the Foundation as authorized in this Article VIII.

_Section 8.6      Non-Exclusivity_

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those provided indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote of Voting Members or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

_Section 8.7      Jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery_

The Delaware Court of Chancery is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification.  The Delaware Court of Chancery may summarily determine the Foundation’s obligation to advance expenses (including attorney’s fees).

The Board of Directors may authorize the Foundation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Foundation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.

_Section 8.9      Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
