---
Effective January, 2018 all Readium SDK software is permissively licensed free of charge under the 3-part BSD license and the previous fee-based Alternative License is not longer offered. Adopters are encouraged to help support Readium SDK development and maintenance by paying an optional annual support fee. Those parties paying support will receive priority attention from the Readium SDK team.
