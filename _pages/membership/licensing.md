title: Readium Licensing
---
Effective January, 2018 all Readium SDK software is permissively licensed free of charge under the [3-part BSD license](https://github.com/readium/readium.github.io/blob/master/license.txt) and the previous fee-based Alternative License is no longer offered. 

Adopters are encouraged to help support Readium SDK development and maintenance by paying an _optional_ annual support fee. Those parties paying support will receive priority attention from the Readium Support team.
