I work for Sony DADC and oversee the DigitalWorks group. We have been working alongside the foundation on our new eBook DRM. Itâ€™s in our interest to see Readium continue to mature and be supported with features and improvements as our DRM is reliant on it for market adoption and success. We fully support Readium 2 and plan on implementing it with the [URMS Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-urms-reader/id1274807900?mt=8) as soon as it becomes available. I personally believe in open source projects and will be fully committed to the board.

I am also a board member at Library For All and Readium is an important part of the technology platform used to deliver mother tongue eBooks to the poorest of the poor children - helping them to learn how to read. In addition to being a board member I also chair the technology committee at LFA.
