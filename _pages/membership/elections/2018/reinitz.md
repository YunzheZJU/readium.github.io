I am excited for the opportunity to participate on the board of the Readium Foundation and to positively influence the future evolution of open source tools used for reading and interacting with EPUB 3 books. If elected I will bring a fresh and unique perspective to the board that should be helpful in tackling remaining challenges related to expansion of the EPUB 3 ecosystem.

In my current role as a Director of Product Management at ProQuest I am responsible for the patron reading experience for our Ebook Central platform which is available via academic libraries and other institutions throughout the world. We are focused on creating the best reading experience for academic and scholarly content and on improving the usability and accessibility of our platform as a research tool.

Prior to joining ProQuest I gained experience in digital publishing working as a Product Manager for Amazon Kindle. I had the opportunity to build publishing tools for authors at CreateSpace and Kindle Direct Publishing and bear witness to the explosive growth of independent publishing. I also spent time product managing the cross platform development of Kindle Reader features such as X-Ray and the Home and Library experience.

On behalf of ProQuest I plan to be an active participant in the Readium Project going forward, and it would be my honor to serve on the board of the Readium Foundation.
