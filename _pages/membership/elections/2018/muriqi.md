Dear Readium Foundation:

Please consider this email my self-nomination as a candidate for the Readium Foundation Board of Directors.

I am an active contributor to Readium and currently working with EDRLab where I actively support the Readium project and the development of Readium 2. I am also an Apple Swift Ambassador and have extensive experience working with both the Apple and the Android development teams.

Currently, I am a consultant for Sony Corporation where I developed and launched The URMS Reader, a leading Readium based iOS and Android reading application used by libraries and retail eBook stores. 

My experience and expertise with Readium, LCP, URMS and Adobe will make me a valuable addition to the Readium board. I strongly believe in open source and am committed to supporting the project.
