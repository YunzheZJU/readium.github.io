### Dear Readium Foundation Members, 
 
I would like to offer my candidacy as a Readium Board of Director's member as a representative of IBM Corporation.   I believe I can offer the Foundation my extensive knowledge of Open Source as well as my experience sitting on the boards of Dojo Foundation and being  on the board and being President of Open Ajax Alliance from inception. 
 
As CTO in IBM, I am responsible to insure we have an Accessibility Strategy for our products and the documents we create.     IBM joined the Readium Foundation  because we feel strongly that EPUB should be the standard for digital publications both internally and externally.       Additionally, we are going to work within the foundation to insure that the SDK produces accessible output so as to provide equal access to all. 
 
EPUB is very important to us as it is based on Web Technologies that we have been working in the industry on for many years;  namely  XHTML, XML, CSS, SVG. 
 
If elected to the board, I will be committed to assisting on the board on all matters relating to the foundation including trying to attract new members and developers.
