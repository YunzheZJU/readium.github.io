Please accept my application as a candidate for the Readium Foundation Board of Directors. My experience with Learning Ally combined with a strong Financial Services background uniquely positions me to act as an industry partner to drive the adoption of standard technologies and processes across the publishing and digital book production industries.  My experience working with for-profit and not-for-profit teams has taught me the value of partnership and collaboration in the process of driving transformational change.   I am passionate about the opportunities for our industry to more effectively innovate and serve our customers and leverage the strengths we have while protecting those capabilities that make us each unique.

As a hands-on technology leader and member of the Board, I will bring additional strength and partnership to the Foundation technology team and look for ways to increase adoption and  accelerate adoption of EPUB 3 and the Open Web Platform by the global digital publishing industry.
