title: Candidate Statement - Hadrien Gardeur

Since we've officially launched the Readium Foundation in March 2013, I've dedicated a large portion of my time to the foundation as the group lead on Readium LCP (Lightweight Content Protection, an alternate DRM for EPUB).
 
Readium Foundation feels like a natural extension to some of the work that I've been involved with and the next step for an open ebook ecosystem. 
 
As a board member, I would bring this vision to the table of an ecosystem centered around EPUB, but that also encompass a variety of standards and open source projects.  Readium Foundation is a great place to host such projects, and based on my experience working across the industry (Feedbooks is a retailer that works closely with application developers, publishers and libraries) and leading technical efforts (group lead on LCP and OPDS, co-editor and author of multiple IDPF specifications), I'll do my best to make this happen. I will also continue to focus on helping Readium LCP evolve from a specification, to a reliable industry standard for DRM.
