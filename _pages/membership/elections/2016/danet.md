### Readium Foundation is a great industry initiative.

The breadth and depth of work done by volunteers under the Readium banner is nothing short of amazing.   Team dedication to facilitating shared solutions among industry partners is a testament to the power of what can happen when people of good intentions, even when they’re competitors, come together to progress on the technology side.

### Under my leadership, Hachette Livre has been supporting Readium web at its beginning in March 2012. 

Our technical efforts started in Readium Web at its early beginning, with one Hachette developper, Vincent Gros, as the unique contributor of the French version. We do want to continue these efforts.

Under my leadership, an European dedicated (aka EDRLAB) team has been financed, hired for helping Open Source and Epub in Europe.

In July 2015, the European Digital Reading Lab has been opened in Paris. I’m now the first President of this Non Profit Organization dedicated to Europe, Accessibility, Interoperability and Open Sources.

### Epub 3 and following releases, Open Web Platform remain a priority project for Hachette teams.

Hachette and its engineers have been thoroughly involved in Epub 3.1 specifications, Readium SDK and LCP workstreams.

With W3C membership, Hachette has taken a new step up in standards : challenging the Open Web Platform to cope with publishing needs. Hachette technology teams have joined their forces in the tasks forces of the DIGIPUG Interest.

### Readium needs a strong technology governance.

Readium needs for Publisher viewsrepresented on the Board. The majority of members is certainly on the vendors side. But Readium deserves other perspectives to decide any next steps. I can represent this Publisher sensitivity inside Readium Governance.

Readium needs secured governance. Open collaborative projects may face technical and legal risks. **I commit myself to pay deep attention to technology and legal choices**.

Coordination between Readium Foundation and EDRLAB must be secured. The creation of EDRLAB gives us a great opportunity to speed up Readium projects but that gives us also the responsability of a good coordination
