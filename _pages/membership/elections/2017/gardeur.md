As a elected board member of both Readium Foundation and EDRLab, my first focus has been on turning LCP from a vague idea into a real solution that will be launched in early 2017.

I've played a key role in this development as the core editor of both the [License Content Protection](http://readium.github.io/readium-lcp-specification/) and [License Status Document](http://readium.github.io/readium-lsd-specification/) specifications, and in helping EDRLab to set up a real certification process.

Feedbooks is also the main contributor to the Readium-2 effort, for which we've provided:

- most of the architecture ([https://github.com/readium/readium-2](https://github.com/readium/readium-2)) and specification ([https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest)) documents

- the entire codebase for the first implementation of Readium-2 in Go ([https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-go](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-go))

Readium-2 represents the first step to help the foundation evolve from an EPUB centric organization into a truly open source effort for digital publishing on the Web.

With this renewed focus, Readium can work hand in hand with the W3C and the industry to create together the next generation of publications.
