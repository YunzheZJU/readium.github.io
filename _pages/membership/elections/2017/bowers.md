I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve the Readium community. I have been deeply involved with the foundation from the very beginning and I'd like nothing more than to continue to help steer the organization to further success and long term sustainability.

I am passionate about creating great digital reading experiences and pragmatic digital publishing technologies. I would like to continue to bring both this passion and my deep experience in this arena to bear in service to this organization and our fellow members.

As Founder and CEO of Bluefire Productions LLC, I have the honor to serve over 100 companies in the digital publishing industry in 37 countries. We provide web and ereader technologies to retailers, publishers, library systems, and distributors. Bluefire is an independent 100% employee-owned company founded in 2001. Our tight-knit small team operates out of Seattle Washington. 

Bluefire has consistently demonstrated a sincere commitment to the Readium Foundation.  We provided seed funding to help the nascent organization get off the ground, actively recruited our customers, partners, and competitors to join as members, and have contributed substantial code and technical expertise to the projects.  We have every intention of continuing to contribute long term to the foundation in support of the mission to accelerate the adoption of EPUB3 and open web standards in digital publishing.

I humbly ask for your vote, and if elected I will continue to serve you my fellow members with integrity, energy, and commitment.
