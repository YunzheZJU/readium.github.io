As an employee of the American Printing House for the Blind (APH), I am a member of the Technology Product Research group where our goal is to research and produce technology and software to aid in the education and independent living of the blind and visually impaired. By being a member of the Readium board, I wish to participate in producing open source and highly accessible software that supports the open EPUB standard. Clearly, my primary goal is to be able to influence and leverage the work of the foundation's projects to the benefit of the blind and visually impaired, either directly or by integration into future APH products. I am also a firm believer in open source software that is cross-platform, choosing open source solutions whenever possible. I can offer the board my years of experience as a computer scientist and consultant with advanced degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy problem-solving by writing code driven by practicality. You can view my LinkedIn profile at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtribbey/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtribbey/)
