I work for Sony DADC and oversee the global DigitalWorks group. We have been working alongside the foundation on our new eBook DRM that’s compatible with Readium. It’s in our interest to see Readium continue to mature and be supported with features and improvements as our technology is reliant on it for global market adoption and success.

We also want to ensure that Readium remains open to all technologies so a vibrant ecosystem can continue to develop for the benefit of all participants.

I have been with Sony for over 25 years, most of that time working for Sony Music and Sony DADC in North America, Europe and Asia. I have held senior positions in operations, finance and sales.  I also advise a few technology startups in the UK and NYC.
