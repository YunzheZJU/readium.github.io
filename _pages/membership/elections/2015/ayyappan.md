Dear Readium Foundation Members,

I am grateful for the opportunity to represent Adobe in applying for a seat on the Readium Foundation Board.

Adobe has been a trusted partner to the publishing industry for more than 20 years and has helped define many of the publishing standards in use today. Adobe has been involved with the Readium Foundation for the last one year, and we wish to strengthen our relationship with this foundation. Weâ€™re keen to help steer the foundation to further success and long term sustainability.

Adobe today possibly supports the largest ecosystem of readers that leverage the Readium SDK. It recognizes the importance of digital publishing, and EPUB to the current and future generations of book readers and offers its leadership and experience to Readium in this endeavor.

As the business owner for eBooks at Adobe, I work with publishers, distributors, retailers and e-reader developers across the globe. I hope to leverage this broad perspective and help steer the foundation to further success and long term sustainability.

I humbly ask for your vote and if elected I will be committed to assisting on the board on all matters relating to the foundation.

Thank you,

Shameer Ayyappan
