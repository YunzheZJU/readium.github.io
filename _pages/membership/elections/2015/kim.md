Dear Members of Readium Foundation,

It is a general trend that public standard based on the open source would finally be selected by a large number of industrial participants, even though its current market share is lower than existing dominant but proprietary technology. Consequently, the dominant technology in the eBook industry would be replaced with IDPF EPUB standard with Readium SDK in the near future as various new eBook business models have emerged.

It would be an honor for me to make substantial contributions to the Readium Foundation as one of the Board of Directors. I consider it as my mission to make Readium LCP technology itself more capable and usable in a global EPUB community by providing seamless interoperability. I commit myself to actively do it employing my 22-year experiences in my professional area, and try to be a Korean representative to convey any requirements from the Korean eBook industry to future Readium specifications.
