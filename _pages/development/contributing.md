## Introduction

As an open-source project, the Readium Foundation welcomes contributions from everyone - from individuals, groups and corporations. The best way to get started with Readium is to read through the introductory materials on this site, subscribe to the mailing list and, of course, get the source code and start spelunking through it.

An important note to bear in mind is that YOU are the Readium team. Readium has no "dedicated team". Other than a consultant or two and a couple of part-time employees, everything in Readium is done by the Readium contributors - some employed by Readium Foundation members, some simply individual contributors.

## Contributing as a developers

The Navigation bar contains a Development entry that leads to an overview of each project, with links to the Github repositories where you'll find the Readium open-source codebase.

Before contributing to the different projects with your Pull Requests, make sure you've signed and sent the [Readium ICLA](/documents/Individual Contributor License Agreement.pdf) (for Individual Contributor License Agreement).

### Face to Face Meetings

Periodically, we try to arrange a face-to-face meeting of the developers and contributors. These usually but not always coicide with Readium membership meetings and/or major eBook conferences like Book Expo America, or TPAC.

### Meeting Archives

The agenda and notes from all the meetings are archived in the Readium Google doc tree. Access to all the archives can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzaNaBNAB6FjRmFocHotbV9nMFU?hl=en).

### The Readium-Engineering Meeting

The Readium-Engineering meeting is focused on the current development initiatives. This is the meeting most likely to be of interest to new contributors.

### The Triage/Planning Meeting

The Thursday meeting varies in its content, but tends to be broader in scope than the main engineering meetings. Sometimes if focuses on reviewing the open issues or some particular topic. Other times, the meeting focuses on planning for one or more facets of the project over the near or medium term. Longer term planning tends to be held at the membership and board level.
