## Introduction

While the Web is the largest collection of interlinked documents ever created, it lacks a mechanism for expressing how a collection of resources, when grouped together can represent a publication.

Publication formats such as EPUB or CBZ/CBR group these documents together using a container format, making them easier to archive or transmit as a whole. But they also break an important promise of the Web: the resources of a publication are not available through HTTP to any client that would like to access them.

W3C has recently provided a definition for a [Web Publication](https://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/):

> A **Web Publication (WP)** is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.

It also provides a definition for a manifest in the context of a Web Publication:
> [...] **manifest** refers to an abstract means to contain information necessary to the proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on. The precise format of how such a manifest is stored is not considered in this document.

Readium Web Publication Manifest is an attempt to standardize a JSON based manifest format that follows both definitions.

To facilitate the interoperability between EPUB and Web Publications, this document also defines a number of extension points to fully support EPUB specific features.

## Abstract Model

The Readium Web Publication Manifest is based on a hypermedia model inspired by [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287), [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) and [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/) among others.

There are three core concepts to this model:

- [collections](#collections)
- [metadata](#metadata)
- [links](#links)

Collections are identified by their role and they can either contain:

- metadata, links and other collections for *"full collections"*
- or just links for "*compact collections"*

The Readium Web Publication Manifest is a full collection in this abstract model.

## JSON Serialization

### Collections

This specification defines two collection roles that are the building blocks of any manifest:

| Role  | Semantics | Compact? | Required? |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| spine  | Identifies a list of resources in reading order for the publication.  | Yes  | Yes  |
| resources  | Identifies resources that are necessary for rendering the publication.  | Yes  | No  |

Additional collection roles are defined in the [Collection Roles registry](roles.md).

Extensions that are not registered officially must use a URI for their role.

A manifest must have one `spine` collection where the main resources of the publication are listed in the linear reading order:

```json
"spine": [
  {"href": "/chapter1", "type": "text/html"},
  {"href": "/chapter2", "type": "text/html"}
]
```

Other resources that are required to render the publication are listed in a `resources` collection:

```json
"resources": [
  {"href": "/style.css", "type": "text/css"},
  {"href": "/image1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}
]
```

### Metadata

JSON-LD provides an easy and standard way to extend existing JSON document: through the addition of a context, we can associate keys in a document to Linked Data elements from various vocabularies.

The Web Publication Manifest relies on JSON-LD to provide a context for the `metadata` object of the manifest.

While JSON-LD is very flexible and allows the context to be defined in-line (local context) or referenced (URI), the Web Publication Manifest restricts context definition strictly to references (URIs) at the top-level of the document.

The Web Publication Manifest defines an initial registry of well-known context documents, which currently includes the following references:

| Name  | URI | Description | Required? |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
[Default Context](contexts/default/) | http://readium.org/webpub/default.jsonld  | Default context definition used in every Web Publication Manifest. | Yes |

Context documents are all defined and listed in the [Context Documents registry](contexts/).

The Readium Web Publication Manifest has a single requirement in terms of metadata: all publications must contain at least a `title` in their `metadata`.

```json
"metadata": {
  "title": "Test Publication"
}
```

In addition to `title`, this specification also recommends including `@type` to describe the nature of the publication described by the manifest.

```json
"metadata": {
  "@type": "http://schema.org/Book",
  "title": "Test Publication"
}
```

### The Link Object

The Link Object is used in `links` and in compact collections to list resources related to a collection. 

It requires at least the presence of `href` and `type`:

| Name  | Value | Format | Required? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| href  | Link location.  | URI  | Yes  |
| type  | MIME type of resource.  | MIME Media Type  | Yes  |
| title  | Title of the linked resource.  | String  | No  |
| rel  | Indicates the relation between the resource and its containing collection.  | One or more [Link Relation](relationships.md) or URI (extensions)  | No  |
| properties  | Properties associated to the linked resource.  | [Properties Object](properties.md)  | No  |
| height  | Indicates the height of the linked resource in pixels.  | Integer  | No  |
| width  | Indicates the width of the linked resource in pixels.  | Integer | No  |
| duration  | Indicates the length of the linked resource in seconds.  | Float| No  |
| templated  | Indicates that the linked resource is a URI template.  | Boolean, defaults to false  | No  |


### Links

A manifest must contain at least one link using the `self` relationship.
This link must point to the canonical location of the manifest using an absolute URI:

```json
{
  "rel": "self",
  "href": "http://example.org/manifest.json",
  "type": "application/webpub+json"
}
```
A manifest may also contain other links, such as a `alternate` link to an EPUB 3.1 version of the publication for example.

Link relations that are currently used in this specification and its extensions are listed in the [Link Relations registry](relationships.md).

## Content Documents

Contents documents are the resources listed in the `spine` collection of a Web Publication.

Any text, image, video or audio format that can be opened in a Web browser is a valid content document format.

## Discovering a Manifest

To indicate that a content document is associated with a particular Web Publication Manifest, use a `link` element in the HTML `head`:

```html
<link href="manifest.json" rel="manifest" type="application/webpub+json">
```

The manifest can also be associated with any resources served over HTTP using the `Link` header:

```
Link: <http://example.org/manifest.json>; rel="manifest";
         type="application/webpub+json"
```

Finally, a manifest may also be embedded in an HTML document using the `<script>` element:

```
<script type="application/webpub+json">
{
  "@context": "http://readium.org/webpub/default.jsonld",
  "metadata": {"title": "Example"},
  "links": [
    {"rel": "self", "href": "http://example.org/manifest.json", "type": "text/html"}
  ],
  "spine": [
    {"href": "chapter1.html", "type": "text/html", "title": "Chapter 1"}
  ]
}
</script>
```

## Table of Contents

A Web Publication Manifest can indicate that a table of contents is available using the `contents` relation in a Link Object listed in `spine` or `resources`:

```json
{
  "rel": "contents", 
  "href": "contents.html", 
  "type": "text/html"
}
```

The Link Object must point to an HTML or XHTML document. 

A client may also rely on the `title` key included in each Link Object of the `spine` to extract a minimal table of contents.

[The EPUB extension](/extensions/epub.md) also defines [specialized collection roles](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest/blob/master/extensions/epub.md#collection-roles) for embedding various tables of contents directly in the manifest.

## Cover

A Readium Web Publication Manifest can also provide a cover using the `cover` relation in a Link Object listed in `spine`, `resources` or `links`:

```json
{
  "rel": "cover", 
  "href": "cover.jpg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg", 
  "height": 600, 
  "width": 400
}
```

The Link Object must point to an image using one of the following media types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif` or `image/svg+xml`. 

## Packaging a Web Publication

The Readium Web Publication Manifest is primarily meant to be distributed unpackaged and exploded on the Web.

That said, a Readium Web Publication Manifest may be included in a classic EPUB, but reading systems have no obligation to access the manifest.

If a Readium Web Publication Manifest is included in an EPUB, the following restrictions apply:

- the manifest document must be named `manifest.json` and must appear at the top level of the container
- the OPF of the primary rendition must include a link to the manifest where the relationship is set to `alternate`

```xml
<link rel="alternate" href="manifest.json" media-type="application/webpub+json"/>
```

In addition to the EPUB format, a Readium Web Publication can also be distributed as a separate package:

- the package itself must be a ZIP archive
- the manifest document must be named `manifest.json` and must appear at the top level of the package
- all resources in `spine`, `resources` and `links` that are referenced using a relative URI, must be referenced relatively to the manifest
- its media type is `application/webpub+zip`
- its file extension is `.webpub`
- a publication where any resource is encrypted using a DRM must use a different media type and file extension
