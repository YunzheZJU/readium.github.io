### Accessibility - EPUB 3 Resources and Guidance

There is a range of guidance available for creating Accessible EPUB files - some high level and some more technical.  DAISY has pulled together a page [here](http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/) which provides best practices for creating accessible EPUBs.

### epubcheck

The epubcheck tool is the gold standard as far as EPUB 3 validation goes. epubcheck is currently hosted on a [github project](http://github.com/idpf/epubcheck) under the same name. The latest stable build is typically linked to from epubcheck's main page, but can also be found by clicking on the Downloads tab.  An online version of the tools is available [here](http://github.com/idpf/epubcheck).

### EPUBTest.org

The website [epubtest.org](http://epubtest.org/) is a collaboration between BISG, DAISY Consortium and the IDPF to provide a unified home for the definitive EPUB 3 Reading System Conformance Testsuite.
