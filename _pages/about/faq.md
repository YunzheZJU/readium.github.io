# Readium.org Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQ)
Below FAQs are divided into categories (General, Readium Foundation, Readium.js, Readium Chrome Extension and the Cloud Reader, Readium SDK, and Readium LCP).

 

## General FAQs

- How can I help the Readium projects?

There are many ways to help the Readium projects. You donâ€™t have to be a C++ developer or JavaScript guru.  If you have these skills and want to help, you are of course very welcome!  But we also have great needs for testers, documentation, translators and many other areas.  If you want to help please [contact us](mailto:rkwright@readium.org)!

 

### FAQs about the Readium Foundation (Readium.org)

- What is the relationship between Readium and standards bodies such as the IDPF and W3C?

In early 2017, IDPF  combined with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is responsible for HTML and other Web Standards, thus standards development for EPUB and other publishing technology for the Web Platform is now taking place within W3C. For more information see Publishing@W3C [ link to https://w3.org/publishing]. A number of Readium Foundation members and contributors are participating in Publishing@W3C activities to help ensure coordination. 

Governance of Readium Foundation is by board of directors elected by representatives of its member organizations.



## FAQs About the ReadiumJS Project

- What is the status of cross-browser support in Readium.js?

Readium.js is architected to work on any modern (HTML5) browser. The Readium Chrome Extension obviously only functions in the Google Chrome browser. However, the Readium Cloud Reader is a full EPUB 3 implementation that runs in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera on essentially all platforms supported by those browsers.  However, given the huge matrix of browsers and platforms, Readium is working hard to ensure that the functionality is equivalent across all the platforms.  That is very difficult and Readium welcomes all who would report problems or, even better, help us make our support more complete.

 

## FAQs About the Readium Chrome Application and the Cloud Reader

- Is the Readium Chrome Extension a consumer-grade EPUB reading system?

The original intent of the Readium Chrome extension was  to be used primarily by authors, publishers, and developers creating and testing EPUB 3 content and tools. However the Readium Chrome Extension now has almost 600,000 active users (as of February 2016) and has been translated into 11 languages with the help of our contributors, so clearly we have exceeded that expectation.  That said, there is more to be done to make it a full-fledged EPUB reader.  While RCE supports almost all of the EPUB 3.0.1 standard, there are still some missing features (e.g. a sortable library, annotations, search, etc.), but  the Readium Foundation intends to continue expanding and supporting it in the future..

- Will the Readium Chrome Extension or Cloud Reader open DRM-protected eBooks?

At this time there are no plans for Readium Chrome Extension to support DRM-protected eBooks.

- Will the Readium Chrome Extension or Cloud Reader support other publication formats besides EPUB?

Not at this time. We have considered supporting PDF, but as an open-source effort we are dependent on volunteers to provide the resources for such undertaking.  At present, such an effort is not in our scope.

- Are the Readium Chrome Extension and Cloud Reader accessible?

Yes! Basic accessibility support has been implemented.  We are continuing to work actively on improving that support.  Readium welcomes all reports of areas where we can improve our support and especially welcome any contribution to its development and testing.

- Are the Readium Chrome Extension and the Cloud Reader localized to languages besides English?

Yes, 11 languages are currently available for both the Chrome Extension and the Cloud Reader. Contributions of translation assistance are very welcome, as an internationalization infrastructure is in place.  If you wish to help, please contact us by email.

- Do the Readium Chrome Extension, Cloud Reader and Readium SDK share source code?

Yes, the Cloud Reader and the Chrome Extension share almost all their source code, the primary difference being that the Chrome Extension is naturally packaged as a Chrome Extension. The Chrome Extension, Cloud Reader and SDK also share a large section of their code, written in JavaScript.

- Can I deploy the Cloud Reader on my own site?

Yes!  And it is very easy.  Please see the instructions here.  If you have problems or questions, please contact us via email or find us on Slack (instructions here).

 

## FAQs About the Readium SDK

- Do I have to obtain a commercial license to use the Readium SDK?

No. Effective January, 2018 all Readium SDK software is permissively licensed free of charge under the 3-part BSD license and the previous fee-based Alternative License is not longer offered. Adopters are encouraged to help support Readium SDK development and maintenance by paying an optional annual support fee. Those parties paying support will receive priority attention from the Readium SDK team.

- Does the SDK support DRM?

Yes, it does but the SDK is DRM-agnostic. This means the SDK has been developed so it can be used with many different kinds of DRM-encrypted books or no DRM at all.  No DRM at all is the default.  Readium will of course support Readium LCP (see below).  This support should be added very soon (spring 2016). For other DRMs, the support must be added by the vendor and is specific to their particular application,

- Does the SDK support other book formats than EPUB?

Not at this time. We have considered supporting PDF, but as an open-source effort we are dependent on volunteers to provide the resources for such undertaking.  At present, such an effort is not in our scope.
