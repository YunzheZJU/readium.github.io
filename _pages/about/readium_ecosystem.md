The Readium project was begun in 2012 as a demonstration of the potential of EPUB 3.  It has developed well over the last 6 years, but the underlying devices and software tools have improved greatly, leading to the realization that a re-boot was needed.

Readium has therefore been working on new solutions.  The result is a new lineup of reading system technologies and products that bring better performance, greater accessibility and even better reading experiences.

At this time (late 2018), Readium comprises:

### Readium Mobile iOS 
- a SDK (software development kit) for developing reading system for iOS devices
- a sample test app is available in the iOS store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r2-reader/id1363963230?mt=8)

### Readium Mobile Android 
- a SDK for for developing reading systems for Android devices
- a sample test app is available in the GooglePlay store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readium.r2reader&hl=en_US)

### Readium Desktop 
- a SDK for for developing reading systems on Windows, MacOS and Linux devices based on TypeScript/JavaScript and Electron
- an early version of the application is available here
- the app will eventually replace the Readium Chrome app 

### Readium Web 
- a SDK for reading Web Publications (both EPUB and the developing W3C variants) on the Web
- this SDK is currently in development
- a full-fedged app based on the SDK is under development
- it will eventually replace the Readium Cloud Reader

Each of the SDKs are under active development and will be provided with a framework facilitating testing against the exiting EPUB tests as well as the tests being developed by the W3C Community Group.

Each of the SDKs will support

- EPUB 2 and 3.x
- CBZ (for image-based publications)
- Web Publications
- audio-books (in an upcoming W3C format)

The architecture of the second-generation Readium reading systems (which you will see sometimes referred to a "R2") has been designed and implemented to provide a very powerful and flexible support for not only EPUB, but CBZ, audio and other formatsthat have not even been designed yet.

As an open-source effort the Readium Foundation and EDRLab welcome support form any and all, whether that support is development, testing, documentation or funding. Come join us!
